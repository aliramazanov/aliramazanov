Full-stack Software Developer with expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
Enthusiastic about clean UI design using CSS, Tailwind, or SASS, currently practicing Data Structures and Algorithms, with plans to learn Next.js and Nest.js.
Also interested in Data Visualization, particularly exploring D3 projects due to my background in Finance and Accounting.
